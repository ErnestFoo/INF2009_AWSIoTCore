**1. Introduction**

 AWS IoT core is a cloud managed service, which lets you connect to edge devices and makes it possible to develop applications that can act on the data generated by edge devices. It support a large volumne of messages and can route those messages to AWS services or other devices reliably and securely. One of the main aspects of AWS IoT code is the device communication and supports three main protocol: MQTT, HTTP, and websocket. In this lab, we will learn how to connect a thing aka device in IoT core, establish secure connection from raspberryPi over MQTT protocol and then ingest real-time data into a no-sql dynamodB database.

**2.Setup IoT Thing aka Device in IoT Core**

**Let us first create thing in AWS IoT core. Thing in IoT core means any edge device and in our case it would be a raspberryPi device. Head over to your AWS console and go to IoT Core. Please ensure you have configured your aws region to Singapore i.e., _ap-southeast-1_ (You can switch region from your console top right selecton).**

- **Part 1:** Within the IoT core console, go to Manage -> All Devices -> Things. Click on "Create things" and then select "_Create single thing_" (as we are only setting up one raspberryPi). Once done, click next. Please refer to below video for reference.

- **Part 2:** Enter "_Thing Name_" (You can keep any name you want). Also, you should create a thing type to group all raspberryPi devices into one. Once done, click next. Please refer to below video for reference.

- **Part 3:** Do note to NOT use any special character like '#' in thing name. In the next screen, Please select "_Auto Generate a new Certificate_". Once done, click next. Please refer to below video for reference.

- **Part 4:** Next, before finish creating "_Thing_", we need to create IoT policy to grant certain permissions to AWS IoT resources. For demonstration purpose, we are going to give permissions to all actions and resources (using wildcard operator '*') but in practice, you must only give those permissions, which are required. Please refer to below video for reference.

- **Part 5:** Once Policy is created, click on "Create thing". This will create the "thing" for you and also generate set of security files for you to download. Please download following three files from the console and save in a folder onto your computer desktop:
  1. Device Certificate > Rename to aws-certificate.pem.crt
  2. Public Key File -> Rename to  aws-public.pem.key
  3. Private Key File -> Rename to aws-private.pem.key

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac6a3ae7-f5c8-488d-a8cb-60963dc9b6b2

- **Part 6:** Once you have downloaded and saved all the three security files, click Done and you can now see the created "IoT Thing" under Manage -> All Devices -> Things. Next, go to Manage -> Security -> Certificates to view the certificate(s) IoT core created in previous step.

- **Part 7:** Next, we are going to attached certificate to our IoT Thing and already created IoT policy as shown below.

**3.Setup RaspberryPi to send any data over MQTT to IoT Core**

**In this section, we are going to use a simple python code to establish MQTT connection to AWS IoT Core and send some data to demonstrate.**

-  Set up and activate a virtual environment named "awsiotcore" for this experiment (to avoid conflicts in libraries) as below:
  
  ```bash
  sudo apt install python3-venv
  python3 -m venv awsiotcore
  source awsiotcore/bin/activate
  ```

-  Installing paho-mqtt and psutil:

  ```bash
  pip install paho-mqtt
  pip install --upgrade psutil
  ```

-  Next, Please download the files (.py and rootCA ) in [sample code](aws_iot_core) and save in same folder as the three security files. Your folder should look like as below screenshot:

 <img width="699" alt="Screenshot 2025-03-11 at 1 46 40â€¯PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ffd875a-42c0-4226-b97a-00747131bd00" />

-  Now, we are ready to execute python file on RaspberryPi device. But, before that need to ensure entire folder is transferred to RaspberryPi device. You can use any filter transfer tool like winscp or even commpan line scp like below to transfer entire folder to your device.

 ```bash
  scp -r aws_iot_core <rpihostname>@<rpi_IP_address>:/path/to/home
 ```

-  Sample code](aws_iot_core/pipython.py) is used to connect establish MQTT connection. Ensure security file names mentioned in line 17 of this code matches with that of in your folder. Finally, paste your AWS IoT core endpoint in line 15. You can find endpoint in your IoT Core Consle under Connect -> Domain Configurations -> Domain Name.

  ```bash
   client.tls_set(ca_certs='./rootCA.pem', certfile='./aws-certificate.pem.crt', keyfile='./aws-private.pem.key', tls_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv23) #Line 15
   client.connect("xxxxxxxx-ats.iot.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com", 8883, 60) #Line 17
  ```

- **Part 2.** Edit line number 11 as shown below to enable quantization in [sample code](Codes/mobile_net.py) to use quantized version of MobileNetV2 model.

  ```message = json.dumps({"time": int(time.time()),"quality": "GOOD","hostname": "rpiedge","value": psutil.cpu_percent()},indent=2)
  ```

    Finally, observe the fps as shown in screenshot below after using quantized model of MobileNetV2. We can now achieve close to 30 fps as required because of smaller footprint of quantized model.

    [Quantization](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/quantization.html) techniques enable computations and tensor storage at reduced bitwidths compared to floating-point precision. In a quantized model, some or all operations use this lower precision, resulting in a smaller model size and the ability to leverage hardware-accelerated vector operations.

- **Part 3.** Uncomment lines 57-61 in [sample code](Codes/mobile_net.py) to print the top 10 predictions in real-time as shown in below video.

**3. Quantization using Pytorch**
- Neural networks typically use 32-bit floating point precision for activations, weights, and computations. Quantization reduces this precision to smaller data types (like 8-bit integers), decreasing memory and speeding up computation. This compression is not lossless, as lower precision sacrifices dynamic range and resolution. Thus, a balance must be struck between model accuracy and the efficiency gains from quantization.

- In this section, we would learn how to use Pytorch to perform different quantization methods on a neural network architecture. There are two ways in general to quantize a deep learning model:

    1. Post Training Quantization: After we have a trained model, we can convert the model to a quantized model by converting 32 bit floating point weights and activations to 8 bit integer, but we may see some accuracy loss for some types of models.
    2. Quantization Aware Training: During training, we insert fake quantization operators into the model to simulate the quantization behavior and convert the model to a quantized model after training based on the model with fake quantize operators. This is harder to apply than post-training quantization since it requires retraining the model, but typically gives better accuracy.

- Please refer to [sample jupyter notebook file](Codes/PyTorch_Quantisation.ipynb), which demonstrates how to quantized a pre-trained model using post-training quantization approach as well as quantization aware training. Please run the sample code preferably in google colab if you do not have computer with good hardware specs.


**4. Homework and Optional Exercise**
- Try running quantized version of some large language models (like llama, mixtral etc.) on Raspberry Pi. This [link](https://www.dfrobot.com/blog-13498.html) demonstrates some of the LLMs on Raspberry Pi 4 and 5.
- Take any complex Deep Learning Model like resnet, mobileNet OR your own architecure and try different quantization methods as explained in section 3. Once deployed on RaspberryPi, Observe the size, performance and speed of the quantized model.
